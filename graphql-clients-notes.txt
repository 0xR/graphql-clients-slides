background
    frontend architect
    help teams setup and design
    do presentations for sharing knowledge
    currently considering graphql for client
    created some poc apps
    picked libraries
        webpack babel
        react from angular, redux
        jest with snapshot testing
        react storybook
Contents
    plain gql important for whether you need a client
    End with a comparison table of apollo and relay
picking JS libraries
    Does it solve problems I have
        productivity
        useful abstraction
        avoid tech envy
        https://twitter.com/i/moments/801085643547930624
    Does it introduce less problems than it solves
        still flexible or more framework
        easy to learn, API surface
        make my app slower
        testable
    Is it well supported
        less of in issue for smaller libs
        support yourself
        commit activity
    Can I migrate away when things change
        flexibility
        better solution
        tbh, react or preact?
        change support
        version 2
        business requirements change
    Quote heraclitus
Plain graphql
    Avoiding multiple rountrips
        microservices
        or proper REST
        under fetching
        server rendering for inital pageload
    Over fetching
        Big domain
        more latency than bandwidth
        Multiple clients / views
    Have schema for cross team communication
        multiple teams
        contract driven development
        automatic mocking
            graphql-tools apollo
        find breaking API changes
    Might introduce problems
        learn it
        maintain server
        ensure team autonomy
    plain client code
        POST json
        Stringify query / variables
        error handling
    demo eslint plugin
        colocation does not work
colocation
    code example
    spread syntax
    query in different file
    string driven development
    stringly typed
Lokka
    small bundle size
    nice fragment syntax
    watch query cache 
        avoid same query
        refetch
    code example
state management difficulty
    demo apps
        show network tab
        all clients
        redux devtools
            state tree
        relay devtools
            no state
    what logic has to be written
        loading state
        Error state
        optimistic updates
            write heavy applications
        cache management
            invalidation
        interactive websites
        productivity app
        state normalization
            fetching same resource multiple sources
            fetching same resource over time
Apollo
    manages your state
        loading state
        error state
        state selectors
        state normalization
    integration with redux
        any frontend framework
        serverside rendering
        app local state
    works with any graphql backend
    runtime  query compiler or separate file
    Compose the data fetching on any component
Relay
    specific server implementation
    build time query compiler
    React Only
    difficult to integrate with redux
    Every component is wrapped in Relay container
    serverside rendering support third party
Relay specific server changes
    global id was difficult in PoC
    Typename + id => base64
    can do different pagination, best integrated
relay2
    complete rewrite
    faster / simpler
    native prefetching
    local state management
    streaming pagination
    custom extension of graphql
    mirgration path with a compatiblity layer
    announced end of the year @facebook react native -> to the web
performance
    more problems than it solves
    bundle size
    tti
    prefetching
support

        last week announced to stop on metor
        small company in sri lanka
        Not much commit activity
    apollo
        meteor funding 31M
        blogposts / talks
        leverage redux ecosystem
    Relay
        desktop app native
        every react native app used relay
        used main facebook site
        relay 2
            issues closed
Comparison tabel
    API -> add new problems
